Known limitations
=================

- Resource files must have unique names (without the extension)
- Resource files cannot be placed at subfolders

- Custom components should inherit directly from Component class,
  as multiple levels of inheritance are not supported currently.
- Using the default Storage subsystem, saving a scene and then
  changing the type of a component's field could lead to errors.
